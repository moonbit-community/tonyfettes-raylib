## How to Play

Defend the central factory core from incoming enemy waves. Shoot enemies to earn scrap, then use scrap to place turrets around the arena. Manage your heat gauge -- overheating stops your gun temporarily. Collect energy pickups to maintain your resources. Survive 10 waves to win. Build combos by chaining kills for bonus score.
