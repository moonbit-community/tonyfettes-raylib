## How to Play

Swap adjacent candies on an 8x8 board to form matches of 3 or more in a row or column. Matching 4 or 5 creates special candies with powerful effects. Each level has a limited number of moves and a jelly-clearing objective -- clear all jelly tiles to advance. Chain reactions from cascading matches build combos for bonus points. Hints appear automatically if no move is made.
