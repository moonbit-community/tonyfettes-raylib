# raylib_void_anchor_raid_2026

A twin-stick shooter where you capture void anchors while fighting waves of enemies. Hold position near anchors to claim them, collect energy orbs, and use dash and pulse abilities to survive in an arena with destructible walls.

## Build and Run

```bash
cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_void_anchor_raid_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_void_anchor_raid_2026/raylib_void_anchor_raid_2026.exe
```

## Controls

- **WASD/Arrows**: Move
- **Mouse**: Aim
- **Left Click / J**: Shoot
- **K**: Dash (costs energy)
- **L**: Pulse attack (area effect, costs energy)
- **R**: Restart

## How to Play

- Void anchors spawn in the arena; stand near them long enough to capture them
- Each captured anchor awards points and progresses the raid
- Enemies attack in waves with increasing difficulty; multiple enemy types
- Collect energy orbs dropped by defeated enemies to fuel abilities
- Build combos for score multipliers; manage HP, energy, and weapon heat
