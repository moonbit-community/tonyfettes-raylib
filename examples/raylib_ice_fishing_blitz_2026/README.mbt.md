# Ice Fishing Blitz 2026

An arcade ice fishing game where you lower a hook through a frozen hole, catch fish of varying types and value, and avoid underwater hazards like jellyfish, eels, and ice chunks.

## Build and Run

```bash
cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_ice_fishing_blitz_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_ice_fishing_blitz_2026/raylib_ice_fishing_blitz_2026.exe
```

## Controls

- **W/A/S/D or Arrow Keys**: Steer the hook underwater
- **J or Space**: Grab/release fish
- **K**: Boost (turbo reel speed)
- **Touch buttons**: On-screen d-pad, hook, boost, repair, hint, and restart

## How to Play

Lower your hook into the ice hole and maneuver it through the water to catch fish (trout, salmon, and rare golden fish). Bring hooked fish back to the catch zone at the surface to score. Avoid jellyfish, eels, and ice hazards that damage your fishing line. Manage your line HP, bait supply, and turbo fuel. Collect floating pickups (bait refills, line repairs, thermos warmth). Reach the score goal within the time limit across escalating waves.
