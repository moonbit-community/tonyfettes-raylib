# Portal Blackout Escape 2026

A stealth puzzle game on a dark grid-based map. Navigate through a blacked-out facility, collect energy cores to power a portal network, avoid patrolling drones, and reach the exit before time runs out.

## Build and Run

```bash
cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_portal_blackout_escape_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_portal_blackout_escape_2026/raylib_portal_blackout_escape_2026.exe
```

## Controls

- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Move on the grid (one tile at a time)
- **Space / E / J**: Action -- teleport when near a portal, or drop a flare EMP elsewhere
- **H**: Cycle through hint messages
- **R**: Restart
- **Escape**: Return to title
- **Mouse / Touch**: On-screen D-pad, action, hint, restart, and menu buttons

## How to Play

The facility is shrouded in darkness. Collect 6 of the 8 scattered energy cores to power the portal network and unlock the exit gate. Use two portal pads to teleport across the map. Drop flare EMPs to temporarily reveal the surrounding area and stun nearby drones. Drones patrol set routes and switch to hunting mode if they spot you. Getting caught costs a life (3 total). Manage your flare energy carefully and reach the exit within the 210-second time limit.
