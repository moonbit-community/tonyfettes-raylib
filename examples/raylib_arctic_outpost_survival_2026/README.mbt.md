## How to Play

Survive 200 seconds against wolves, brutes, and ice shards attacking your outpost. Collect fuel, medkits, ammo, and overdrive pickups that spawn periodically. Monitor suit HP, core heat (your repair resource), and fuel. Storms periodically reduce visibility and increase enemy aggression. Eliminate enemies in quick succession for combo bonuses.
