# Aftershock Rescue Convoy 2026

A top-down rescue mission game where you drive a convoy vehicle through earthquake-ravaged districts, picking up survivor groups and delivering them to hospitals while navigating crack zones, dust clouds, and debris.

## Build and Run

```bash
cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_aftershock_rescue_convoy_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_aftershock_rescue_convoy_2026/raylib_aftershock_rescue_convoy_2026.exe
```

## Controls

- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Drive the convoy
- **J / Space**: Boost (uses battery)
- **L / U**: Action (pick up / drop off survivors, use medkits)
- **K / H**: Ping (reveals nearby survivor groups)
- **Enter / R**: Restart
- **F11**: Toggle borderless windowed

## How to Play

Drive between disaster districts to locate and rescue survivor groups. Pick up survivors (limited capacity), then deliver them to hospitals. Avoid crack zones and obstacles that damage your hull. Use ping to find hidden groups and medkits to heal critical survivors. Manage hull integrity and battery while keeping district stress levels from overloading.
