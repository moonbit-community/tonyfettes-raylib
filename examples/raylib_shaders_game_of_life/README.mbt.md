# raylib_shaders_game_of_life

Placeholder for a GPU-based Conway's Game of Life shader example.

## Status

This example is currently **blocked** -- it requires a `RenderTexture.texture` accessor that is not yet available in the MoonBit raylib bindings. The `moon.pkg` file is kept for future implementation.
