## How to Play

Navigate a tile-based temple filled with enemies, spike traps, and pressure plates. Collect relics for score, push crates onto plates to open paths, and defeat various enemy types. Manage your HP and stamina while building combos. Each enemy type has different movement and attack patterns. Clear the temple of threats and gather as many relics as possible.
