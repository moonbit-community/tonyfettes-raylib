# raylib_dragon_scroll_keeper_2026

A wave-based defense game set in a dragon scroll vault. As the Keeper, defend the vault's scroll integrity across three interconnected chambers by fighting raiders, extinguishing fires, and sealing breaches.

## Build and Run

```bash
cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_dragon_scroll_keeper_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_dragon_scroll_keeper_2026/raylib_dragon_scroll_keeper_2026.exe
```

## Controls

- **WASD / Arrow keys**: Move the Keeper between chambers
- **J**: Attack raiders / Seal breaches
- **K**: Toggle extinguisher mode (switch between combat and fire-fighting)
- **L**: Deploy ink shield (area damage + fire suppression)
- **P**: Pause
- **R**: Restart
- **F11**: Toggle borderless windowed

## How to Play

- Protect scroll integrity from raiders who invade through breaches and fires that spread between rooms
- Attack raiders in combat mode; switch to extinguisher mode to quench flames
- Seal breaches with seal charges to prevent more raiders and embers from spawning
- Deploy ink shields for emergency area defense (limited stock, long cooldown)
- Survive escalating waves; each wave grants additional seal charges
