# Ancient Temple Trap Run 2026

A top-down puzzle-platformer where you navigate through trapped temple chambers, collecting relics and avoiding hazards across multiple stages.

## Build and Run

```bash
cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_ancient_temple_trap_run_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_ancient_temple_trap_run_2026/raylib_ancient_temple_trap_run_2026.exe
```

## Controls

- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Move player
- **Shift / K**: Dash (drains stamina)
- **R**: Restart stage
- **Space / Enter**: Start / advance to next stage
- Touch controls available on-screen

## How to Play

Explore temple chambers with spike traps, dart launchers, lava hazards, and pressure-plate-activated doors. Collect all required relics in each stage to unlock the exit. Dashing lets you move faster but drains stamina -- picking up relics restores some. Step on pressure plates to temporarily open linked doors. Complete all 3 stages to achieve victory.
