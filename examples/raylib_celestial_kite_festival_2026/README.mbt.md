## How to Play

Guide your kite through the festival sky, collecting lanterns and celestial orbs while avoiding storms and hostile birds. Rescue koi fish for bonus points. Use dash to dodge hazards and reel to change altitude quickly. Each stage has a collection goal -- meet it to advance. Manage your kite's health; getting hit causes temporary invulnerability. Build combos by collecting items in quick succession.
