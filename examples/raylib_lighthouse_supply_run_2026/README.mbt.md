# Lighthouse Supply Run 2026

A maritime logistics game where you pilot a supply vessel through stormy seas, delivering fuel to lighthouses scattered across the map while avoiding reefs, storms, and pirates.

## Build and Run

```bash
cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_lighthouse_supply_run_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_lighthouse_supply_run_2026/raylib_lighthouse_supply_run_2026.exe
```

## Controls

- **W/A/S/D or Arrow Keys**: Steer the supply vessel
- **J or Space**: Load/unload cargo at dock / sonar ping
- **K**: Repair hull
- **R**: Restart mission
- **Touch buttons**: On-screen controls available

## How to Play

Navigate open waters to resupply lighthouses before their fuel demand runs critical. Each lighthouse has a priority level and increasing urgency. Load cargo at the home dock and deliver to lighthouses in need. Dodge coral reefs that damage your hull, weather storms that push your ship off course, and outrun pirates that pursue and attack. Manage hull integrity and energy reserves across escalating missions.
