```bash
cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_mountain_bike_downhill_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_mountain_bike_downhill_2026/raylib_mountain_bike_downhill_2026.exe
```

## How to Play

- Race downhill through procedurally placed checkpoints at increasing speed
- Jump over rocks and hazards, collect coins and power-ups for score
- Build combos by chaining tricks in the air
- Manage stamina and HP -- hitting obstacles drains health
- Reach as many checkpoints as possible before running out of health
