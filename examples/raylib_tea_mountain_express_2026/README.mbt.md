# Tea Mountain Express 2026

A mountain delivery racing game where you transport tea cargo along a winding mountain road, dodging hazards while managing cargo quality, cart durability, and reputation.

## Build and Run

cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_tea_mountain_express_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_tea_mountain_express_2026/raylib_tea_mountain_express_2026.exe
```

## Controls

- **A/D or Left/Right**: Steer between lanes

## How to Play

Drive a tea caravan down a curving mountain road, reaching checkpoints before time runs out. Avoid rockfalls, landslides, and crosswinds that damage cargo and durability. Near-misses build combos for bonus points. Manage boost heat to avoid overheating. Each successful delivery raises your multiplier and reputation.
