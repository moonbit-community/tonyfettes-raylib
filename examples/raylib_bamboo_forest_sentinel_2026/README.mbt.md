# Bamboo Forest Sentinel 2026

A side-scrolling action game where you defend bamboo forest beacons from waves of enemies using sword attacks, dashes, and traps across a 3-lane corridor.

## Build and Run

```bash
cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_bamboo_forest_sentinel_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_bamboo_forest_sentinel_2026/raylib_bamboo_forest_sentinel_2026.exe
```

## Controls

- **WASD / Arrow Keys**: Move between lanes and along the corridor
- **J**: Attack (melee slash)
- **K**: Dash (with cooldown)
- **Space**: Start game / pause
- **P**: Pause
- **R**: Restart

## How to Play

Patrol a bamboo corridor with 3 lanes, defending beacons from incoming enemies. Use melee attacks to cut down foes and dash to reposition quickly. Beacons lose integrity when enemies reach them -- if all beacons fall, the game is over. Place traps strategically along the lanes. Survive all waves to win.
