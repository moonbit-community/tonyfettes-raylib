# Submarine Sonar Hunt 2026

A submarine exploration game where you navigate through a minefield using sonar pulses to locate hidden targets while managing oxygen, fuel, and hull integrity.

## Build and Run

```bash
cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_submarine_sonar_hunt_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_submarine_sonar_hunt_2026/raylib_submarine_sonar_hunt_2026.exe
```

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys / WASD / D-pad**: Move submarine
- **Sonar button / keyboard**: Emit sonar pulse to reveal mines and targets
- **Boost button / keyboard**: Boost speed (drains extra fuel and oxygen)
- **Mouse/Touch**: UI buttons for mobile-style input

## How to Play

Pilot your submarine through progressively harder missions (up to 9 levels). Use sonar pulses to detect hidden targets in a dangerous ocean arena filled with armed mines. Surfacing replenishes oxygen. Hitting mines damages hull, oxygen, and fuel. Find all targets before resources run out to advance to the next mission.
