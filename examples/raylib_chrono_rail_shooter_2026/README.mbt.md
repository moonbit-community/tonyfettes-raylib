## How to Play

Your ship scrolls forward automatically along the rail. Move to dodge enemy fire and position for attacks. Fire your main gun to destroy enemies and earn score. Use rockets for heavy targets, dash for emergency evasion, and EMP for crowd control. Collect health, energy, ammo, and shield pickups. Watch your heat gauge -- sustained fire causes overheating. Build combos for bonus points.
