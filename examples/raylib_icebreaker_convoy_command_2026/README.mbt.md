# Icebreaker Convoy Command 2026

A tactical escort game where you pilot an icebreaker ship through Arctic waters, clearing ice floes and navigating storm cells to guide cargo convoy ships along waypoint routes.

## Build and Run

```bash
cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_icebreaker_convoy_command_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_icebreaker_convoy_command_2026/raylib_icebreaker_convoy_command_2026.exe
```

## Controls

- **W/A/S/D or Arrow Keys**: Steer the icebreaker
- **J or Space**: Activate ice cutter (breaks nearby ice)
- **K**: Repair hull
- **L**: Sonar ping (reveals ice density)
- **R**: Restart mission
- **Touch buttons**: On-screen navigation and action controls

## How to Play

Lead convoy ships through ice-choked waters by breaking ice floes ahead of them. Convoy ships follow waypoint routes but get stuck on ice and take hull damage. Manage your icebreaker's hull integrity, energy, and cutter heat. Storms drift across the map, intensifying ice formation and damaging ships in their radius. Use sonar to scout ahead. Keep convoy ships alive and deliver their cargo to complete missions.
