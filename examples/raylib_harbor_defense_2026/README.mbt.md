# Harbor Defense 2026

A side-scrolling harbor defense shooter where you control a cannon defending the waterfront against waves of enemy ships while protecting civilian boats.

## Build and Run

```bash
cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_harbor_defense_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_harbor_defense_2026/raylib_harbor_defense_2026.exe
```

## Controls

- **A/D or Left/Right**: Move cannon along the harbor
- **Mouse**: Aim turret direction
- **Space or Left Click**: Fire projectile
- **B**: Launch bomb (area damage, cooldown)
- **F**: Activate shield (temporary protection, cooldown)
- **R**: Restart game

## How to Play

Defend the harbor from incoming enemy ships of varying types. Fire at enemies while avoiding civilian boats for bonus points. Manage your cannon's heat gauge -- overheating temporarily disables firing. Collect pickups that drop from destroyed enemies for repairs, cooldown resets, and score bonuses. Build combos by chaining kills. Survive through escalating waves with increasingly aggressive enemies.
