## How to Play

Explore a 21x13 grid library. Collect all 5 lost pages scattered across the map and activate 3 arcane seals by pushing bookshelves onto glowing circles. Ghosts patrol the corridors and hunt you on sight -- use stun pulses to temporarily disable them, but manage your limited lantern energy. Break line-of-sight around book stacks to evade hunters. Once all seals are activated, the south gate opens for your escape. You have 3 lives.
