## How to Play

Meteors fall from above with varying size and durability. Shoot them to shatter them into ore fragments. Collect floating ore and load it onto convoy trucks traveling in 3 lanes below. Each truck has HP and cargo capacity -- protect them from direct meteor hits. Destroyed trucks respawn after a delay. Keep the convoy moving and loaded with ore to maximize your score across escalating waves.
