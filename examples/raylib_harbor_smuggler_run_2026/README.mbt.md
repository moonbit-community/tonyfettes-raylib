# Harbor Smuggler Run 2026

A stealth-action game where you pilot a smuggler boat through patrol-infested waters, collecting floating crates and delivering them to the drop zone before dawn.

## Build and Run

```bash
cd examples && moon build --target native raylib_harbor_smuggler_run_2026/
cd examples && ./_build/native/debug/build/raylib_harbor_smuggler_run_2026/raylib_harbor_smuggler_run_2026.exe
```

## Controls

- **W/A/S/D or Arrow Keys**: Steer the boat
- **J or Space**: Turbo boost (costs fuel)
- **K**: Stealth cloak (reduces detection range, costs fuel)
- **R**: Restart game
- **On-screen touch buttons**: Also available for mobile-style input

## How to Play

Navigate the dark harbor waters across 3 night missions. Pick up floating cargo crates (worth 1-3 value) and deliver them to the DROP zone on the right side. Patrol boats detect you within a radius and give chase -- use stealth cloak to shrink detection range or turbo boost to ram through them at high speed. Meet the delivery quota each night before the timer runs out. Fuel regenerates slowly but is consumed by boost and stealth abilities.
